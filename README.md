# UWA-PRB
Underwater imaging is challenged by light attenuation, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade image quality and hinder object recognition. The Detecting Underwater Objects dataset shows wide object scale variation, with 27.38% being small objects. We propose UW-Attention-PRB-FPN to enhance small/medium object detection underwater.
